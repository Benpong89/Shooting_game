Architecture and Technologies
This project will be implemented with the following technologies:

Javascript for logic. Canvas for design. Not sure yet what libraries I will need.

Implementation Timeline
Day 1: Set up basic project files. Create HTML And JS files. Start canvassing background. Research libraries to utilize.

Day 2: Start implementing some game logic. Utilize some new libraries. Should be functioning without collisions by the end of the day.

Day 3: Complete collision effects for user, enemies and lasers. Incorporate a scrolling background.

Day 4: Replace basic user and enemy shapes with pictures.

Main components of the game.

Drawing images on canvas
Using DOM key handlers to move images
Using JS logic to:

1.  Produce random enemies
2.  Create collision effect
3.

Bonus

1.  Enemy lasers
2.  Sound effects/explosion effects
3.  Boss fight
4.  Add lives? More than one hit to die
